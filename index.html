      <p>
        My name is Antonio Linero; welcome to my website! I am currently an
        Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Florida State
        University. I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of
        Florida, under the direction of Professor Hani Doss and Professor
        Michael Daniels. I received my B.S. from the University of Florida
        where I studied Finance.

          My research is broadly focused on developing flexible Bayesian
          methods. My work has focused on developing appropriate Bayesian
          methods for complex longitudinal data, as well as developing model
          selection tools within the Bayesian nonparametric framework. I am
          also pursuing research in Bayesian nonparametrics for causal
          inference.

          A related stream of work concerns developing Bayesian methods for the
          analysis of incompletely observed data, which is potentially missing
          not at random (MNAR). MNAR missingness introduces identifiability
          problems, which raises serious questions about how to conduct causal
          inference in, e.g., a randomized clinical trial. The Bayesian
          approach provides, on the one hand, benefits for conducting inference
          in the presence of unidentifiability, but on the other hand Bayesian
          methods may possess suboptimal frequentist properties unless one is
          very careful.
